So, basically what I've been trying to do for the past couple of days is:

1. Get data from Column Equipo_A (Column 13) from WorkBook.1 and look for it in WorkBook2.ColumnA. 
2. I'm going to get multiple matches, so then I need to validate:
    The information of Book1.Column13 should match the information on Book2.ColumnB
3. if so... then I would have to get the information on the cell for Book2.Column10 and write it on Book1.Column19
